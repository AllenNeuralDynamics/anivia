00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:50.939
The green hills and  valleys of Surrey. For centuries,

00:00:50.939 --> 00:00:55.199
this picturesque county has been  a welcome escape from city life.

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:57.269
 But there's more to Surrey than meets the eye.

00:00:57.269 --> 00:00:59.839
 This is one of our  most wooded counties.

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.309
 And it's full of the glories  of autumn.

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:08.000
 I'm in search of the highest point  in southeast England

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.269
 and breathtaking views,

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:12.079
 although today, Baker,   with this weather, I'm not sure.

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:14.889
 It's looking grey but  fingers crossed it'll blow over.

00:01:14.889 --> 00:01:17.889
 I'm going to be heading to  the heart of Surrey's heathland

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:19.349
to find out why this terrain

00:01:19.349 --> 00:01:21.599
 is perfect for training the army's top brass.

00:01:22.809 --> 00:01:24.359
 Keep it moving.

00:01:24.359 --> 00:01:26.989
 Keep it tight, we're on camera.

00:01:26.989 --> 00:01:30.919
 And I'll be here on the east coast  of Scotland, where angry fishermen

00:01:30.919 --> 00:01:33.499
 have declared war  on their counterparts

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:37.249
 from Iceland and the Faroe Islands.   I'll be finding out why.

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.859
 Also on Countryfile tonight,   I'll get help

00:01:40.859 --> 00:01:44.709
 from a Dragon in my quest to make a  profit on the wool from my sheep.

00:01:45.599 --> 00:01:49.209
 We've kind of walked away, said,   "We don't do wool any more."

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:50.469
Well, actually, we do,

00:01:50.469 --> 00:01:52.159
 and we do do it well.

00:02:06.129 --> 00:02:09.740
Just a stone's throw from London,   Surrey is classic commuter-belt.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:10.909
 It's one of England's

00:02:10.909 --> 00:02:14.050
 most crowded counties,   not that you'd know it here,

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:15.599
 because nestling between

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.709
 the rock star mansions  and the stately homes,

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.519
there's plenty of the great outdoors for us all to explore.

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.899
 This is the Greensand Way.

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:30.319
 It's a 100 mile walking trail through Kent and Surrey.

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:33.089
 Surprisingly, it's not that well known in Surrey.

00:02:33.089 --> 00:02:36.409
 It isn't even mentioned in the guide  books, so today I'm exploring

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:39.230
 new terrain. And the one thing  I can tell you already...

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.709
 It's wet underfoot.

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.129
 I'll be navigating through the  Surrey hills to Leith Hill Tower,

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:49.350
 renowned for its outstanding view  over 13 counties.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.509
 Along the way,  there'll be plenty of things

00:02:51.509 --> 00:02:54.420
to see, only not all of them  are so pretty,

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.180
 as I soon find out  at Hindhead Common.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:03.420
 Around a million cars thunder along the A3 every year,

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:06.600
 splitting one of the county's  most treasured landscapes

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.670
 right in two.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:11.480
 Portsmouth is that way,   London is that way,

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.100
 and this is what hikers  have to navigate.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.290
 But not for long. Ooh, he's big.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.540
 A new road-building scheme is under  way, which, surprisingly,

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.459
 should be good news  for the environment.

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.100
 So, what exactly

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.509
 are they doing down there?

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:30.230
 They're going to be bypassing  the village of Hindhead

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.639
 by tunnelling the traffic

00:03:31.639 --> 00:03:33.509
 through these twin bores,

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:37.399
 northbound, southbound,   underneath Hindhead Common.

00:03:37.399 --> 00:03:38.899
What'll happen to the old A3,

00:03:38.899 --> 00:03:41.110
 the one that's over the top  of the common?

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:42.980
 The existing A3  is going to be closed.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.079
 It's going to be punctured, and the  spoil from inside the tunnel

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:47.810
 will be brought over the heathland

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:52.219
 and actually spilt on to the old  road to cover it over and rebury it

00:03:52.219 --> 00:03:55.589
 back to the landscape it used to be.   You're hoping the A3 will come alive

00:03:55.589 --> 00:03:57.939
 again, it's going to wild up?   Exactly that, yeah.

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:00.509
 We're hoping to return it to  wilderness, and regain

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:03.139
the tranquillity that the heathland is famous for.

00:04:03.139 --> 00:04:06.699
 This is such a good-news story.  The traffic's going underground,

00:04:06.699 --> 00:04:09.420
 opening  up the landscape for the walkers,

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.439
 and the wilderness returning.

00:04:11.439 --> 00:04:14.199
 It's one of the biggest heathland  restoration projects

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:15.329
 in Southeast England,

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.759
 and it really is going to allow the  National Trust

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:19.779
to reunite those  two areas of heathland

00:04:19.779 --> 00:04:24.139
 either side that have been blighted  by the traffic just pouring through

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:27.189
 around the Devil's Punch Bowl.   That's going to be totally removed.

00:04:27.189 --> 00:04:31.689
 Heathland is a significant part  of the Surrey landscape,

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:35.060
 and while it may look wild,   it requires constant maintenance,

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.220
 as I discover at Thursley Common.

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.750
 Hello, gents.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:44.060
 It's a bit early to be chopping  down the Christmas trees, isn't it?

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.060
 Hiya. So, a bit of heathland  management going on here?

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.629
 Bit of management. You've caught us  on a bread-and-butter day today,

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:54.140
 but it's really important work  and if we don't do this,

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:58.640
this fantastic landscape disappears  under scrubby birch and pine.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:01.129
 So, these are quite  quick growing, aren't they?

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:03.280
These are very quick growing.

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:07.170
 Yeah. So, you've got to  chop them quite regularly?

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:10.970
We try and clear these areas about  once every five years.

00:05:10.970 --> 00:05:14.960
 We do leave individual specimens  because they're great nest perches.

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.629
 Some of our Dartford warblers,   some of our stonechats

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:21.050
 and in time, we hope, if we leave  some of these to grow on to maturity,

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:23.680
they'll get that nice little bald  patch at their base

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.680
 and, fingers crossed,   we'll get nightjars nesting there.

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:29.350
 Keeping the shrubs under control

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:32.210
 isn't the only thing the wardens  have to worry about.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.250
 Heathland is vulnerable  to wildfires, and four years ago,

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:39.610
 Thursley Common was the scene  of one of Britain's worst.

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:42.850
 The fire devastated huge swathes  of the Common.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:46.410
 This wasn't a one-off event,   either.

00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:49.040
 Heathland fires happen frequently  around here.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.650
 Many are thought to be accidental,  the result of simple carelessness,

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.759
 but some are blamed on arson.

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:57.430
 Including this one,

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.800
 and four years on, the landscape  is only just beginning to recover.

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.930
 How much of the area  was taken out by the fire?

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:07.980
 It was about two-thirds of the site that got completely burnt.

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:10.879
 You can still see the evidence  today, four years on.

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:14.450
 But the good news for us here  is the heather.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:15.900
 Four years ago

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.700
this was a complete smoking black  wilderness, and now look at it.

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:21.990
 The heather's  coming back fantastically.

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.870
 There's a problem there, of course,

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:26.960
 because the heather we've got now  is all very, very even aged,

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.260
 and so much  of our heathland wildlife

00:06:29.260 --> 00:06:32.170
 relies on variation  in the heather size and its age.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:34.740
 A lot of our spiders,   our ground-nesting birds,

00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.129
 things like tiger beetles,   silver-studded blues,

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:39.240
 they're all  key heathland ingredients

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.240
 and they all have their own  very specific requirements

00:06:42.240 --> 00:06:44.260
 in the age of a heathered area.

00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:46.280
 And they were all wiped out?

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.819
 All of that diversity,

00:06:47.819 --> 00:06:50.680
 all of that finesse  in the structure of the site

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:56.069
 that we'd managed for, for many  years, was gone, almost overnight.

00:06:56.069 --> 00:06:59.680
The good news is, a similar thing  happened in the mid-70s,

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:04.000
 and the managers then were able  to steer the site back to health,

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:09.530
 and we're very confident  that we'll do the same this time.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:16.180
 On we go, and I'm finally  getting near my journey's end.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:19.000
 Leith Hill Tower  is an 18th century folly,

00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.900
 built by local aristocrat  Richard Hull.

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:25.180
 It's famed for its panoramic views.

00:07:25.180 --> 00:07:28.470
 Hi, Sam.  Hi.  Nice to get  a little bit of shelter, actually.

00:07:28.470 --> 00:07:30.390
 Yeah, a little bit windy today.

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:32.970
 Tell me about this construction,   Mr Hull's idea.

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.790
 Yeah, Richard Hull, in 1766,

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:39.200
 decided that this was a perfect spot  that he wanted people

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:42.150
to see the countryside,   see England at its best.

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:44.689
 So open for everyone?   Yeah, open for everyone.

00:07:44.689 --> 00:07:46.189
 He built this amazing folly

00:07:46.189 --> 00:07:50.500
for people to go up and see  and view the best of England.

00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.189
 At one stage, it closed down,

00:07:52.189 --> 00:07:54.620
 or it wasn't as open  as it should have been.

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:57.620
 Richard Hull didn't live  for very long after it was built,

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:01.280
 and when he died,   it got left in a bit of disrepair,

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.300
 we had vagrants  living here and stuff,

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:04.750
 and it was a real problem,

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:07.189
 so it ended up  getting filled in and closed up.

00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:10.280
 But then Mr Evelyn,   who took over the area,

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:13.796
 he then did a bit of work and  built this extra extension onto it.

00:08:13.796 --> 00:08:16.756
This is an extra bit, is it?   Yeah, this extra bit.

00:08:16.756 --> 00:08:19.516
 You can see the old doorway from the original bit there.

00:08:19.516 --> 00:08:23.836
 But this was added on and it was then all opened back up again.

00:08:23.836 --> 00:08:26.456
 Is it true that you can see 13 counties from the top?

00:08:26.456 --> 00:08:29.736
 It is, and in fact,   we did a bit of research lately

00:08:29.736 --> 00:08:35.316
 and because Greater London  is now formed on its own county,

00:08:35.316 --> 00:08:38.035
 you can actually  now see 14 counties.  Ah!

00:08:38.035 --> 00:08:40.755
 It'd have to be a very good,   clear, open day

00:08:40.755 --> 00:08:45.485
to see some of the features of those 14 counties, but it is possible.

00:08:45.485 --> 00:08:47.836
 I'm not sure how lucky  I'm going to be today,

00:08:47.836 --> 00:08:50.555
 but I'm going to go  and have a look.

00:08:50.555 --> 00:08:51.956
 Go for it.  Wish me luck.

00:08:51.956 --> 00:08:55.055
 Richard Hull made sure  his tower was tall enough

00:08:55.055 --> 00:08:57.915
to become the highest point  in the Southeast.

00:08:57.915 --> 00:09:00.115
Just as well,   with weather like this.

00:09:00.115 --> 00:09:01.805
 Let's hope we'll see something.

00:09:03.815 --> 00:09:08.365
 So, here we are. Officially the highest point of the Southeast.

00:09:08.365 --> 00:09:10.805
 Richard Hull Esquire's vision,

00:09:10.805 --> 00:09:15.495
 that we should be able to see 14 counties from up here.

00:09:15.495 --> 00:09:18.255
 Today, you're lucky to see two.

00:09:18.255 --> 00:09:21.115
 Even on a day like this, though,

00:09:21.115 --> 00:09:24.395
 with the folly towering above the surrounding countryside,

00:09:24.395 --> 00:09:27.395
 you can still see  for miles and miles.

00:09:31.245 --> 00:09:34.055
That's London  underneath the cloud cover there.

00:09:34.055 --> 00:09:37.615
 You can just about  make out Canary Wharf.

00:09:40.805 --> 00:09:44.935
The South Downs. Actually,   not a bad view of the South Downs.

00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:49.576
 A fine folly indeed.

00:09:51.076 --> 00:09:52.855
The tower is nearly 250 years old,

00:09:52.855 --> 00:09:56.045
 yet Hull's dream  of giving the public

00:09:56.045 --> 00:10:00.025
 a place where they can admire  the best of England lives on.

00:10:02.935 --> 00:10:06.635
 Somewhere down there, Matt's getting  a lesson in a traditional craft.

00:10:06.635 --> 00:10:08.745
 We'll be catching up with him  in a while.

00:10:08.745 --> 00:10:10.805
 First, mackerel fishing  has long been

00:10:10.805 --> 00:10:13.336
 one of the most profitable  industries in the UK.

00:10:13.336 --> 00:10:16.905
Today, this multi-million-pound  business is under threat.

00:10:16.905 --> 00:10:19.665
 Tom Heap  is in Scotland investigating.

00:10:22.905 --> 00:10:26.885
 It's Sunday evening and the Kings  Cross is leaving Fraserburgh Harbour

00:10:26.885 --> 00:10:28.525
 on the east coast of Scotland.

00:10:28.525 --> 00:10:33.305
 She's heading north to waters  off the Shetland Islands.

00:10:33.305 --> 00:10:38.605
 The skipper is hoping to return  with a healthy catch of mackerel,

00:10:38.605 --> 00:10:41.466
 as much as 700 tonnes.

00:10:41.466 --> 00:10:44.515
 Armed with one of our cameras,   a scientist on board

00:10:44.515 --> 00:10:47.885
 is going to record  the journey for us.

00:10:50.326 --> 00:10:51.735
 A little further south,

00:10:51.735 --> 00:10:54.925
the fish market at Peterhead  prepares to open for business.

00:10:54.925 --> 00:10:59.326
This is one of the UK's  busiest fishing ports.

00:11:01.716 --> 00:11:03.495
 ï¿½80...

00:11:03.495 --> 00:11:06.456
 Fishing may not be the industry  it once was in Scotland

00:11:06.456 --> 00:11:08.466
 but it still employs  a lot of people.

00:11:08.466 --> 00:11:10.576
5,000 fishermen, 2,000 boats

00:11:10.576 --> 00:11:13.255
 and many more  when the fish get to land,

00:11:13.255 --> 00:11:16.675
 but now an international row  is rocking the boat.

00:11:16.675 --> 00:11:18.826
 And mackerel is at the heart of it.

00:11:18.826 --> 00:11:22.206
The UK fishing industry  has been infuriated

00:11:22.206 --> 00:11:24.405
 by the decision of Iceland  and the Faroe Islands

00:11:24.405 --> 00:11:26.985
 to dramatically increase the amount of mackerel

00:11:26.985 --> 00:11:29.985
that they're taking from the sea.

00:11:29.985 --> 00:11:34.485
 But quotas set by the EU control how  much the Scottish fleet can catch.

00:11:34.485 --> 00:11:36.925
 Fishermen here  are especially alarmed

00:11:36.925 --> 00:11:40.816
 because mackerel, in contrast to many species like cod or haddock,

00:11:40.816 --> 00:11:43.015
 have been well managed recently.

00:11:43.015 --> 00:11:45.456
 It's that rare thing,

00:11:45.456 --> 00:11:48.836
 a European sustainable fishery,   and it could be lost.

00:11:48.836 --> 00:11:53.615
 In August, local fishermen stopped  a crew from the Faroe Islands

00:11:53.615 --> 00:11:55.535
from landing its haul at Peterhead.

00:11:55.535 --> 00:11:59.895
 One of those involved in the protest  was fisherman George West.

00:11:59.895 --> 00:12:02.375
Their crew came out on the deck  and, of course,

00:12:06.505 --> 00:12:10.956
 a little bit of aggro...   and not much said.

00:12:10.956 --> 00:12:13.255
 How did things reach such a pitch

00:12:13.255 --> 00:12:16.115
 where it got to the point  where there was a stand-off

00:12:16.115 --> 00:12:17.755
 literally at the sea wall here?

00:12:17.755 --> 00:12:19.865
 It was borne out of frustration

00:12:19.865 --> 00:12:22.305
 and we couldn't believe  we were in a situation

00:12:22.305 --> 00:12:24.696
 where the Faroe Islands and Iceland  were trying to go away

00:12:24.696 --> 00:12:28.025
 with a large proportion  of our mackerel quota.

00:12:28.025 --> 00:12:31.446
 So now, because of the action then,

00:12:31.446 --> 00:12:34.775
there are no Faroese or Icelandic  boats landing mackerel here?

00:12:34.775 --> 00:12:35.995
 No, there aren't.

00:12:37.586 --> 00:12:43.025
 It's not the first time British and  Icelandic fleets have come to blows.

00:12:43.025 --> 00:12:47.855
The so-called Cod Wars of the 1970s  saw Royal Navy warships

00:12:47.855 --> 00:12:52.355
 dispatched to the North Atlantic  to protect our fishing vessels.

00:12:52.355 --> 00:12:54.415
 The funny thing is, back then

00:12:54.415 --> 00:12:57.745
 such a dispute over mackerel  would have been inconceivable.

00:12:57.745 --> 00:13:00.175
They weren't part  of your average fish dinner,

00:13:00.175 --> 00:13:03.836
 and even now, they're not a big part  of our daily diet.

00:13:03.836 --> 00:13:07.535
 But across the world,   they are very highly prized,

00:13:07.535 --> 00:13:11.525
 meaning they're now the most valuable  part of the Scottish catch.

00:13:11.525 --> 00:13:14.895
 This box alone? About ï¿½500.

00:13:14.895 --> 00:13:17.436
 Of course, it's not just fishermen

00:13:17.436 --> 00:13:19.865
 who rely on the mackerel for a living.

00:13:19.865 --> 00:13:22.076
There are thousands more  who depend on the fish.

00:13:22.076 --> 00:13:25.725
 Robert Duthie manages one of the local processing plants.

00:13:25.725 --> 00:13:29.385
 At the height of the mackerel season,   he employs more than 200 people

00:13:29.385 --> 00:13:33.745
 who process up to 800 tonnes  of mackerel every day.

00:13:33.745 --> 00:13:35.475
 We depend on Scottish fishermen

00:13:35.475 --> 00:13:39.045
 landing Scottish fish  into this factory.

00:13:39.045 --> 00:13:41.245
 And the worry we have

00:13:41.245 --> 00:13:44.806
 is that if there are any changes  in the quota systems

00:13:44.806 --> 00:13:48.235
 that our vessels  get less fish to catch.

00:13:48.235 --> 00:13:50.905
 Do you think that the Scottish fishermen are right

00:13:50.905 --> 00:13:53.336
 to be pretty angry  about the way this has gone?

00:13:53.336 --> 00:13:56.056
 I think they are.   Obviously we have to support them.

00:13:56.056 --> 00:13:58.306
They're the lifeblood  of the communities

00:13:58.306 --> 00:13:59.946
 in this part of the world.

00:13:59.946 --> 00:14:04.125
 Icelandic fishermen say they should catch more mackerel

00:14:04.125 --> 00:14:07.635
 because there's been a change  in the migration pattern of the fish,

00:14:07.635 --> 00:14:09.846
 bringing more of them   into their waters.

00:14:09.846 --> 00:14:11.625
 But there's real controversy

00:14:11.625 --> 00:14:15.045
 about whether there's evidence  to back up this claim.

00:14:15.045 --> 00:14:18.605
 Fish stocks are very much  your speciality and where they go.

00:14:18.605 --> 00:14:20.105
Tell me about the mackerel.

00:14:20.105 --> 00:14:24.275
 Atlantic mackerel is a species which  has a very large migration pattern.

00:14:24.275 --> 00:14:26.576
 It all starts  in this area down here.

00:14:26.576 --> 00:14:29.995
 The southwest and west of Ireland  in the early spring and summer,

00:14:29.995 --> 00:14:33.885
 where the males and the females  get together and they spawn.

00:14:33.885 --> 00:14:36.096
 After the eggs  have been fertilised,

00:14:36.096 --> 00:14:40.076
the adults then undertake  this migration pattern

00:14:40.076 --> 00:14:43.686
 up along the shelf edge here that's  close to the 200-metre contour,

00:14:43.686 --> 00:14:46.686
 up into this area around here,   into the Norwegian Sea,

00:14:46.686 --> 00:14:49.355
 and they occupy the surface waters  in this area here.

00:14:49.355 --> 00:14:53.155
 Is their pattern of movement  changing?

00:14:53.155 --> 00:14:55.596
 one of the foundations

00:14:55.596 --> 00:14:58.686
 is that mackerel are in different  places than they were before.

00:14:58.686 --> 00:15:00.466
 Is that true, as far as you know?

00:15:00.466 --> 00:15:02.956
 Well, to our knowledge  there's no evidence

00:15:02.956 --> 00:15:05.535
 that the core of the migration  pattern has changed.

00:15:05.535 --> 00:15:07.931
What has happened is that stock  is now at a size

00:15:07.931 --> 00:15:10.410
 where it's bigger than it's been for many years

00:15:10.410 --> 00:15:12.890
 and we've seen evidence  of an expansion of the area

00:15:12.890 --> 00:15:14.301
 which the stock occupies.

00:15:14.301 --> 00:15:17.020
 So, it's just because  there are few more of them,

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:20.110
 they might have expanded  into slightly different waters?

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:21.431
That's possible.

00:15:21.431 --> 00:15:25.410
 It's now 15 hours since  the Kings Cross left Fraserburgh.

00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:28.931
 She's reached the waters  west of the Shetland Islands.

00:15:28.931 --> 00:15:33.240
The crew have hit upon  a large shoal of mackerel

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.290
 and they're beginning to haul in the catch.

00:15:36.290 --> 00:15:41.400
 It's a large,   industrial-scale operation,

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:46.551
 a far cry from what mackerel fishing  used to be like.

00:15:46.551 --> 00:15:49.181
 For years, I've taken holidays  in Scotland

00:15:49.181 --> 00:15:52.181
 and enjoyed the pleasures  of mackerel fishing.

00:15:52.181 --> 00:15:55.230
 I know that it's not just the big  boats that will be affected

00:15:55.230 --> 00:15:58.691
 if this dispute continues,   but the little ones too.

00:15:58.691 --> 00:16:02.591
 Morning, Baden.   Good morning, good morning.

00:16:02.591 --> 00:16:06.571
 How are you?  Fine, thank you.   Working away already, I see.

00:16:06.571 --> 00:16:10.181
 Making ready for going to sea,   to see if we can get that mackerel.

00:16:10.181 --> 00:16:12.951
Well, Baden, it's nice  to get on board the May Lilly.

00:16:12.951 --> 00:16:14.490
 Mind your feet.

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:17.400
 Are you getting her  all ready to go out?

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:19.321
 All ready to go, very nearly.

00:16:19.321 --> 00:16:22.040
 How important is mackerel fishing to people like you?

00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:24.150
 Well, mackerel fishing,

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:28.040
 it's always been important in small  villages, small coastal communities,

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:32.311
 simply because  it's environmentally friendly,

00:16:32.311 --> 00:16:34.880
 you don't catch anything else,  just mackerel,

00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:41.640
 and doesn't damage the sea bed  and to use the word sustainable,

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:45.061
 it's the most sustainable method  of fishing that there is.

00:16:45.061 --> 00:16:50.591
 Plus, it's very little outlay apart  from a few hooks and a stripper.

00:16:50.591 --> 00:16:53.171
 what do you think about the current dispute

00:16:53.171 --> 00:16:55.510
 with the Icelanders and the Faroese?

00:16:55.510 --> 00:16:58.000
 Well, short of saying  maybe too much...

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:00.951
 Say what you like.  Aye!

00:17:00.951 --> 00:17:05.730
 But I wish we had a government  that supported our fishermen

00:17:05.730 --> 00:17:09.201
 in the same way  as the Faroese government

00:17:09.201 --> 00:17:12.341
 and the Icelandic government  supports their fishermen.

00:17:12.341 --> 00:17:13.790
 But if they don't get a deal

00:17:13.790 --> 00:17:16.561
 and the different countries  catch more and more fish,

00:17:16.561 --> 00:17:19.471
 what could happen to the stocks of mackerel out there?

00:17:19.471 --> 00:17:21.151
 I doubt if they would be allowed.

00:17:21.151 --> 00:17:24.760
 I doubt it's in any country's  interest to fish them to extinction.

00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:28.040
 All that the governments in  Iceland and Faroe are doing,

00:17:28.040 --> 00:17:33.760
 they're supporting their fishermen,   because it's their main industry.

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.451
Talks are now going on

00:17:35.451 --> 00:17:38.500
 between all the sides involved  in the mackerel dispute.

00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.800
 After hearing  from the Scottish fishermen,

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:42.911
 it's time I made a call

00:17:42.911 --> 00:17:45.911
 to the head of the Icelandic  negotiating team, Tomas Heidar,

00:17:45.911 --> 00:17:47.641
 to get his take on the row.

00:17:47.641 --> 00:17:50.451
Tomas, perhaps you could tell me  first of all

00:17:50.451 --> 00:17:54.480
 why Iceland has decided to increase  its quota of mackerel

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:56.361
 so dramatically.

00:17:56.361 --> 00:17:59.451
 'It is no secret  that the migration of mackerel

00:17:59.451 --> 00:18:03.490
 'has changed dramatically  during recent years

00:18:03.490 --> 00:18:10.280
 'so this is why we've been catching  more during the last years.'

00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.691
 You say the migration...

00:18:11.691 --> 00:18:13.330
 Sorry to interrupt you, Tomas,

00:18:13.330 --> 00:18:16.520
 but you say the migration pattern  of mackerel has changed.

00:18:16.520 --> 00:18:19.141
We've spoken to scientists  from Marine Scotland

00:18:19.141 --> 00:18:20.691
 who say it's hasn't changed,

00:18:20.691 --> 00:18:23.641
they still follow the same routes that they did before.

00:18:23.641 --> 00:18:27.721
 'We have an Icelandic,   Norwegian, Faroese survey

00:18:27.721 --> 00:18:30.070
 'that was made both last year  and this year.'

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:34.280
 So the scientist is wrong?   The scientist I spoke to is wrong?

00:18:34.280 --> 00:18:39.111
 'Well, if it's a scientist from the  EU, it may be explained by the fact

00:18:39.111 --> 00:18:42.350
 'that the EU has refused  to take part in this survey.'

00:18:42.350 --> 00:18:46.000
 So the EU and Norway  should catch fewer mackerel

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.790
 so that the Icelanders  and the Faroese can catch more?

00:18:50.790 --> 00:18:53.080
 'I mean, that's the issue  in a nutshell.'

00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:57.300
 But how can...  'I think everybody  realises that. I think...'

00:18:57.300 --> 00:18:59.040
 I don't think they do.

00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:02.361
 I'm sat next to Scottish  mackerel fishing boats here

00:19:02.361 --> 00:19:05.931
 and I don't think the captains  of these boats realise that.

00:19:05.931 --> 00:19:10.570
 After three days at sea, the  Kings Cross is heading back to port.

00:19:10.570 --> 00:19:12.490
 So how did their fishing trip go?

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:16.381
 The men with the answer  are the skipper, John Buchan,

00:19:16.381 --> 00:19:19.101
 and the Marine Scotland scientist,   Craig Davis,

00:19:19.101 --> 00:19:21.020
 who's been filming the trip for us.

00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:23.550
 The trip was very successful.

00:19:23.550 --> 00:19:26.510
The weather was fantastic  for this time of year,

00:19:26.510 --> 00:19:29.371
 not something that we usually  experience in October,

00:19:29.371 --> 00:19:31.290
 and yes, it was great.

00:19:31.290 --> 00:19:32.550
 So how much did you catch?

00:19:32.550 --> 00:19:37.340
We caught about 1,000 tonnes.  1,000 tonnes?

00:19:37.340 --> 00:19:39.401
 Yeah.  In how long?

00:19:39.401 --> 00:19:41.931
 We trawled for about 30 minutes.

00:19:41.931 --> 00:19:44.320
1,000 tonnes in 30 minutes?

00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:47.461
 That seems incredibly rapid.   It was a very big shoal of fish.

00:19:47.461 --> 00:19:50.461
That's ï¿½1 million-worth of fish.

00:19:50.461 --> 00:19:53.931
They'd reached their quota  and had to stop.

00:19:53.931 --> 00:19:57.490
 Mackerel are still one of the few valuable prizes

00:19:57.490 --> 00:19:58.951
 that lie beneath the waves.

00:19:58.951 --> 00:20:03.121
 But the fear is, if the dispute  over quotas is not resolved

00:20:03.121 --> 00:20:06.871
then it won't be long  before these kinds of catches

00:20:06.871 --> 00:20:08.421
 become a distant memory.

00:20:15.070 --> 00:20:18.401
 Today, Julia and I   are in the Surrey Hills.

00:20:18.401 --> 00:20:20.371
 Over a million people live here,

00:20:20.371 --> 00:20:23.510
 despite it being  one of our smallest counties.

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:25.760
 It's also our most  densely-wooded county.

00:20:29.141 --> 00:20:31.570
 A quarter of Surrey is woodland,

00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:35.280
 and I'm going to spend some  quality time in a small patch of it.

00:20:35.280 --> 00:20:37.760
 This is part of Hindhead Common

00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:40.340
 and it's in the valley  behind the Greensand Way

00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:42.260
 that Julia was exploring earlier.

00:20:45.971 --> 00:20:50.000
This 20-acre chestnut wood  is owned by the National Trust.

00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.721
 It was one of  their earliest acquisitions.

00:20:52.721 --> 00:20:56.560
 Over the years, it was  a little unloved and neglected,

00:20:56.560 --> 00:20:58.111
 but now, all that's changing.

00:20:59.750 --> 00:21:03.921
This woodland here would have  been planted about 100 years ago

00:21:03.921 --> 00:21:06.121
 and it would have been coppiced.

00:21:06.121 --> 00:21:08.421
 Unfortunately,   due to economic reasons,

00:21:08.421 --> 00:21:10.391
 about 30 or 40 years ago,

00:21:10.391 --> 00:21:12.730
 the woodlands wasn't managed.

00:21:12.730 --> 00:21:14.191
 It goes into decline.

00:21:14.191 --> 00:21:15.780
 the Trust as a whole

00:21:15.780 --> 00:21:19.530
 has got about 25,000 hectares  of woodland in the UK.

00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:22.060
We're trying to get that back  into some kind of management.

00:21:22.060 --> 00:21:28.060
 Apart from the chainsaws, coppicing  hasn't changed for centuries.

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:31.480
 It's always involved cutting down  sections of woodland in rotation.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:34.671
 This allows other flora and fauna  the chance

00:21:34.671 --> 00:21:36.730
to flourish on the forest floor

00:21:36.730 --> 00:21:38.941
 and new growth from the old stumps

00:21:38.941 --> 00:21:42.080
 eventually becomes the fence posts of the future.

00:21:44.891 --> 00:21:47.701
Justin Owen started coppicing  as a teenager.

00:21:47.701 --> 00:21:51.411
 I started as a yard labourer  in a local fencing company

00:21:51.411 --> 00:21:55.020
 and used to go out in the old army  lorries to collect the timber,

00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.941
 I always fancied having a go at it.

00:21:56.941 --> 00:21:59.940
 So I just kept nagging the boss  and eventually he said,

00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.140
 "All right, you can have a go."

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:05.067
 And that was when I was  about 18 years old.

00:22:05.067 --> 00:22:07.407
 And have you never left the woods since then?

00:22:07.407 --> 00:22:12.377
 No, I left about 19 years ago to train as an accountant.

00:22:12.377 --> 00:22:14.107
 Right, a bit different, then!

00:22:14.107 --> 00:22:18.468
 Yes, well, I felt I needed to try  a little bit harder and better

00:22:18.468 --> 00:22:21.607
 but then realised that  after ten years of doing it,

00:22:21.607 --> 00:22:23.488
 I didn't really enjoy the job.

00:22:23.488 --> 00:22:26.397
 I enjoyed it out here, so...   Back to the trees, then?  Back home.

00:22:26.397 --> 00:22:29.258
When you come out here,   you see the fresh air,

00:22:29.258 --> 00:22:31.178
the wind, you know, everything.

00:22:31.178 --> 00:22:33.288
 Even when it's snowing,   it's horrible,

00:22:33.288 --> 00:22:35.018
 but it's part of the job.

00:22:35.018 --> 00:22:37.367
 You just get a bigger fire,   cut more timber,

00:22:37.367 --> 00:22:39.617
 get the fire bigger  and work harder.

00:22:47.067 --> 00:22:50.768
 So autumn time, then, this is kind  of the key coppicing season, is it?

00:22:50.768 --> 00:22:52.788
 It's when the seasons really start.

00:22:52.788 --> 00:22:55.738
 You should wait until all  of the leaves are off the tree.

00:22:55.738 --> 00:22:59.117
Why is that? Why around this time?   It's for the sap to come down.

00:22:59.117 --> 00:23:02.768
 Also on some areas,   you've got nesting birds

00:23:02.768 --> 00:23:04.367
 and you want them out of the way.

00:23:04.367 --> 00:23:06.758
 It's the sap,   you want the sap out of the wood,

00:23:06.758 --> 00:23:11.258
 to make it easier to work when  it's green, and it lasts longer.

00:23:11.258 --> 00:23:13.978
 So what's the process going on  in front of us,

00:23:13.978 --> 00:23:17.117
taking the tree down  and chopping it into sections?

00:23:17.117 --> 00:23:20.397
Jack's just putting  the directional cut in

00:23:20.397 --> 00:23:24.337
 and he's aiming it towards the fire,   or as close as he can possibly get,

00:23:24.337 --> 00:23:29.678
then he's going to go round the  back and he'll do the felling cut.

00:23:29.678 --> 00:23:31.647
 He's just putting a wedge in

00:23:31.647 --> 00:23:36.097
to make sure the tree doesn't  fall back on the saw and pinch it.

00:23:36.097 --> 00:23:38.307
 Once he's cut all the way through to the hinge,

00:23:38.307 --> 00:23:42.478
 he keeps knocking the wedge in,   he'll then remove the saw

00:23:42.478 --> 00:23:45.387
 and some of the trees  will just automatically go

00:23:45.387 --> 00:23:47.728
 or he'll have to finish  wedging it over.

00:23:47.728 --> 00:23:52.837
 And if he's got everything right,   the tree should land by the fire.

00:23:52.837 --> 00:23:55.317
 There it goes.

00:23:55.317 --> 00:23:59.968
 Perfect, right on target as well.

00:23:59.968 --> 00:24:03.478
What part of it would he put on the fire and what part will he keep?

00:24:03.478 --> 00:24:08.587
 He'll take off all the brush  and all the side limbs.

00:24:08.587 --> 00:24:11.117
 He'll then cut it into whatever  lengths he thinks is fit

00:24:11.117 --> 00:24:14.827
 and then he'll just stack  everything into individual lengths

00:24:14.827 --> 00:24:18.337
 and products, and pick up  all the brush and burn it.

00:24:18.337 --> 00:24:20.637
We could take the brush  for biomass,

00:24:20.637 --> 00:24:23.117
 but by the time I've got it down  to the barrier,

00:24:23.117 --> 00:24:27.198
 chipped and onto a lorry,   it's just not worth it.

00:24:27.198 --> 00:24:30.248
 Once he's working in a forest,  Justin sets up camp,

00:24:30.248 --> 00:24:34.137
 spending every hour of daylight  on site, chopping down trees

00:24:34.137 --> 00:24:38.587
 and making the wood  into all kinds of useful things.

00:24:38.587 --> 00:24:40.607
 Freddie, what are you up to here?

00:24:40.607 --> 00:24:44.498
 I'm making shakes at the moment,   which are traditional roofing tiles.

00:24:47.408 --> 00:24:50.968
 You end up with your nice tile  shapes.  It's beautiful, isn't it?

00:24:50.968 --> 00:24:54.018
 What else do you make?   We make pegs, which are behind you.

00:24:54.018 --> 00:24:57.488
 How many of those do you make  in a day?  90-odd in a day.

00:24:59.968 --> 00:25:05.307
We also do the fencing market, such  as rails, posts, strainers, struts.

00:25:05.307 --> 00:25:09.528
We also do laths, which are  for traditional plaster.

00:25:09.528 --> 00:25:14.637
 I didn't really do anything before,   I've been through quite a few jobs,

00:25:14.637 --> 00:25:17.268
 landscaping,   and I did hairdressing as well.

00:25:17.268 --> 00:25:19.988
 Hairdressing? Really?   Let's not talk about that!

00:25:19.988 --> 00:25:23.498
We've got to talk  about that now, Freddie.

00:25:23.498 --> 00:25:26.077
 Yeah, it wasn't my choice.  Right.

00:25:26.077 --> 00:25:28.327
 I made teas  and washed people's hair.

00:25:28.327 --> 00:25:30.488
 OK.  And didn't last very long.

00:25:30.488 --> 00:25:34.607
 But you're more suited to this,   I can see.  Yes, far more suited.

00:25:34.607 --> 00:25:37.798
 'Freddie is one  of three youngsters Justin employs

00:25:37.798 --> 00:25:39.387
 'and trains as a coppicer.

00:25:39.387 --> 00:25:41.408
 'Including his son, Jack.'

00:25:42.678 --> 00:25:45.958
 So Justin, what do you see the future of chestnut coppicing as?

00:25:45.958 --> 00:25:48.768
 Because really there aren't that many chestnut coppicers.

00:25:48.768 --> 00:25:51.998
 No, I think you find  around lots of little towns,

00:25:51.998 --> 00:25:55.377
 you'll find the odd one or two  father and sons working around.

00:25:55.377 --> 00:25:57.438
 But you don't find many groups

00:25:57.438 --> 00:26:00.258
that encourage three  youngsters to come up through.

00:26:00.258 --> 00:26:03.577
 Unless people actually help them and bring them in

00:26:03.577 --> 00:26:05.738
 and train them and put up with the cheek

00:26:05.738 --> 00:26:07.758
 and everything that goes with them,

00:26:07.758 --> 00:26:10.798
 then it would be a dying art  and it would be lost forever.

00:26:14.317 --> 00:26:17.077
 Over the last few weeks,   Adam has been on a mission

00:26:17.077 --> 00:26:19.188
to put  British wool back on the map.

00:26:19.188 --> 00:26:21.908
 He's trying to find out if the fleece from his sheep

00:26:21.908 --> 00:26:23.978
 can be turned into a three-piece suit.

00:26:23.978 --> 00:26:27.018
The question is,   will his wool make the grade?

00:26:29.978 --> 00:26:32.698
 The life of a farmer is  always challenging.

00:26:32.698 --> 00:26:35.087
 You never know what the weather  will do

00:26:35.087 --> 00:26:39.448
 and as for the economic climate,   well, that's even harder to predict.

00:26:39.448 --> 00:26:42.347
 But farmers like me are  always up for a challenge.

00:26:51.817 --> 00:26:55.238
When I sheared my lambs at the end  of the summer,

00:26:55.238 --> 00:26:58.897
 I launched my own  personal crusade to try and raise

00:26:58.897 --> 00:27:00.208
 the profile of British wool.

00:27:01.617 --> 00:27:04.897
 Lovely wool, I just can't imagine

00:27:04.897 --> 00:27:06.918
 why it's not just getting

00:27:06.918 --> 00:27:10.288
 snapped up to make fantastic clothing.

00:27:10.288 --> 00:27:14.508
 I met a leading tailor who  assured me that my wool really was

00:27:14.508 --> 00:27:18.817
 good quality and to prove it, he  would make me a suit of my wool

00:27:18.817 --> 00:27:21.587
 once it was spun and woven into  cloth.

00:27:24.918 --> 00:27:26.978
 I'm usually a 34.

00:27:26.978 --> 00:27:28.708
 Your jeans are a 34.  Yeah.

00:27:28.708 --> 00:27:31.478
 So that's... 35 and a half.

00:27:34.478 --> 00:27:38.228
 I'd like to see if turning wool  into cloth can turn a profit.

00:27:41.978 --> 00:27:45.587
 But first I need to know if there's a  real appetite for British wool.

00:27:56.418 --> 00:27:58.998
Just a few miles from my  farm is Stow-on-the-Wold.

00:27:58.998 --> 00:28:03.117
 It's a small town that's grown rich  and famous through the wool trade.

00:28:05.137 --> 00:28:07.908
 Up here is Sheep Street that one  time farmers

00:28:07.908 --> 00:28:11.137
 would have walked their  flocks in to Stow to sell them

00:28:11.137 --> 00:28:14.468
 and it's said they could sell  around 20,000 sheep in one day.

00:28:17.188 --> 00:28:19.908
 But I'm not here to buy  and sell sheep,

00:28:19.908 --> 00:28:24.448
 I'm looking to see if wool is  still a key part of today's fashions.

00:28:24.448 --> 00:28:27.268
 I farm just down the road and  Stow being my local town,

00:28:27.268 --> 00:28:28.857
 what I'm trying to do is find out

00:28:28.857 --> 00:28:31.057
 how many  people are selling British wool.

00:28:31.057 --> 00:28:33.357
 Is this made of wool?  This is a wool-cashmere blend.

00:28:33.357 --> 00:28:35.988
 And this is 100% English wool.

00:28:35.988 --> 00:28:37.768
 Lovely.

00:28:37.768 --> 00:28:42.637
 The price ticket,   ï¿½300 so quite a lot of money.

00:28:42.637 --> 00:28:44.658
 People are willing to spend  the money

00:28:44.658 --> 00:28:47.097
for the quality and  the history of real wool.

00:28:47.097 --> 00:28:50.887
Well, I'm trying to really persuade  more people to appreciate the quality

00:28:50.887 --> 00:28:54.688
 of wool and it's great  you've got as much as you have.

00:28:54.688 --> 00:28:57.317
 So next time, I'll bring my wallet.  Thanks a lot.  Thank you.

00:28:59.658 --> 00:29:03.317
 I'm delighted there's a market for  clothing made from British wool

00:29:03.317 --> 00:29:06.597
 and quite a few of the shops in Stow  do sell quality products.

00:29:06.597 --> 00:29:08.748
 Although quality doesn't come cheap,

00:29:08.748 --> 00:29:12.218
 and now I'm heading off with some  of my raw wool to take it down

00:29:12.218 --> 00:29:15.268
to a spinner who specialises in  spinning British wool

00:29:15.268 --> 00:29:17.754
 to find out  if it's good enough to make a suit.

00:29:20.193 --> 00:29:22.494
 I'm here to meet Sue Blacker  and today

00:29:22.494 --> 00:29:25.953
 I'm showing her my Jacob wool  which has distinct colours.

00:29:25.953 --> 00:29:27.644
 I hope she likes it.

00:29:27.644 --> 00:29:30.644
 Hello.  Lovely to see you again.   Nice to see you too.

00:29:30.644 --> 00:29:32.423
 Now I know you've had my wool before

00:29:32.423 --> 00:29:35.754
 but I've brought you something  a little bit different this time.

00:29:35.754 --> 00:29:38.943
 Yes.  I want to know whether  you think it's any good.

00:29:38.943 --> 00:29:42.744
 I'm on this mission to see the whole  process through

00:29:42.744 --> 00:29:46.114
 and get the guys  in Savile Row to make me a suit.

00:29:46.114 --> 00:29:47.943
Wow! That's great.

00:29:47.943 --> 00:29:50.804
 So I've got some Jacob,   what do you reckon to this?

00:29:50.804 --> 00:29:53.894
 Well, this is quite nice actually.  This is a young one, is it?

00:29:53.894 --> 00:29:57.463
 It is, yes. Young female.

00:29:57.463 --> 00:29:59.994
 Yes, it's good. The black is nice.

00:29:59.994 --> 00:30:02.104
 Normally the black will  be coarser than the white

00:30:02.104 --> 00:30:04.864
 so if the black's nice...  Then the white ought to be OK.

00:30:04.864 --> 00:30:06.554
 Some of it is a little bit short.

00:30:06.554 --> 00:30:08.294
 It is, isn't it?   That's probably no good.

00:30:08.294 --> 00:30:11.104
 Let's have a look at this bit.   That's short too.

00:30:11.104 --> 00:30:13.774
 So what is it you're looking for?

00:30:13.774 --> 00:30:15.653
Well, for a suit we  need to worsted spin.

00:30:15.653 --> 00:30:18.744
 And worsted spinning requires a four inch staple.

00:30:18.744 --> 00:30:22.074
This is more than four inches,   so we're fine with this.

00:30:22.074 --> 00:30:25.074
 OK there, yeah.  Yes, and that's  fine as well. That's nice. Yeah.

00:30:25.074 --> 00:30:28.584
 OK. I've got another one here,  this is from a ram.

00:30:28.584 --> 00:30:30.463
 It's a little bit coarser.

00:30:30.463 --> 00:30:32.433
 It smells like a ram!

00:30:33.983 --> 00:30:36.324
 He is a lot coarser.

00:30:36.324 --> 00:30:39.933
 For the best suiting, you wouldn't  want to use this, to be honest.

00:30:39.933 --> 00:30:41.943
 But we can find some more like this

00:30:41.943 --> 00:30:44.384
 and blend it together  and see what we can do.

00:30:46.594 --> 00:30:50.953
 Good news so far.   Sue can spin my Jacob sheep fleeces.

00:30:50.953 --> 00:30:54.514
 This year, the price farmers  get paid for wool

00:30:54.514 --> 00:30:57.844
 has gone up from a  measly 70p to ï¿½1.20 a kilo.

00:30:59.384 --> 00:31:01.354
 After spinning, it ends up like this.

00:31:02.953 --> 00:31:05.104
What we have here is weaving yarn.

00:31:05.104 --> 00:31:10.213
 It's on cones, ready for them to  pull it off in the mills.

00:31:10.213 --> 00:31:13.074
This is quite fine.

00:31:13.074 --> 00:31:16.074
 It is, isn't it? Very fine.

00:31:16.074 --> 00:31:19.403
 'Now I'm wondering how much Jacob  wool Sue needs

00:31:19.403 --> 00:31:21.604
 'to make enough yarn for a suit.'

00:31:21.604 --> 00:31:25.453
 So, 10 sheep,   about 12 cones, and we're there?

00:31:25.453 --> 00:31:27.233
 Sounds easy. Well, quite easy.

00:31:27.233 --> 00:31:31.544
 It's taken 2,000 years to  get there in technical terms!

00:31:33.794 --> 00:31:36.653
 Sheep farmers work so hard  all year to rear their animals

00:31:36.653 --> 00:31:37.824
 and keep them healthy.

00:31:37.824 --> 00:31:42.044
 And though the majority are for meat,   it's a shame the wool is undervalued.

00:31:47.254 --> 00:31:50.723
 I'm taking some of Sue's  yarn to the weaver's workshop.

00:31:50.723 --> 00:31:54.233
 It needs to go somewhere that really  appreciates the natural colours

00:31:54.233 --> 00:31:55.874
 and textures of British wool.

00:31:55.874 --> 00:31:59.203
That's the challenge for  designer, Rosemary Boon.

00:31:59.203 --> 00:32:03.183
This firm of weavers has been making  fine cloth from British yarn

00:32:03.183 --> 00:32:06.794
for around 250 years, and  supplying some of the top tailors.

00:32:06.794 --> 00:32:08.723
 Hi, Rosemary.

00:32:08.723 --> 00:32:11.953
 Now, I've got some of these yarns for you.

00:32:11.953 --> 00:32:14.903
 Goodness knows whether you  can make a suit from it!

00:32:14.903 --> 00:32:17.114
 What do you think?  That feels great, yes, lovely.

00:32:17.114 --> 00:32:18.703
 Very, very strong. Brilliant.

00:32:18.703 --> 00:32:21.054
 We can certainly weave some of that.

00:32:21.054 --> 00:32:22.784
 Yeah?  Yes.

00:32:22.784 --> 00:32:25.314
 I've got no idea how  much we need, or what the process is.

00:32:25.314 --> 00:32:27.094
 But you've got some lovely  cloths here.

00:32:27.094 --> 00:32:28.973
 It depends what  you're wanting to weave.

00:32:28.973 --> 00:32:34.734
 For a suit length, you probably need  3.5 metres, about four kilos.

00:32:34.734 --> 00:32:36.804
 So we'll see how much we've got.

00:32:36.804 --> 00:32:40.884
We've recently woven a few  British wools into fabrics

00:32:40.884 --> 00:32:43.413
for Paris and Milan exhibitions.

00:32:43.413 --> 00:32:45.193
 Really?  And they were very popular.

00:32:45.193 --> 00:32:48.244
 People love them.   This was made with some Jacob...

00:32:48.244 --> 00:32:51.663
 So this is already Jacob?  Yes.

00:32:51.663 --> 00:32:54.384
 So it might look similar to that.

00:32:54.384 --> 00:32:56.064
Which colours would  you put into there?

00:32:56.064 --> 00:32:59.203
We could mix them all up,   all we could use these two here.

00:32:59.203 --> 00:33:03.193
 So you don't have too much contrast,   you're getting a subtle check.

00:33:03.193 --> 00:33:05.723
 If you use that one, you would  get more of a distinct check.

00:33:05.723 --> 00:33:08.913
 So these would be lovely together.

00:33:08.913 --> 00:33:11.213
We would create a  similar cloth to that.

00:33:12.713 --> 00:33:16.604
 'Rosemary thinks we're in business.'  It's not bad.

00:33:16.604 --> 00:33:18.804
That's nearly enough.

00:33:18.804 --> 00:33:21.804
That's fine. The wool ends up here.

00:33:21.804 --> 00:33:25.784
 And then every single end of the  wool needs to be drawn by Alison.

00:33:25.784 --> 00:33:27.614
 Depending on what design  you're after.

00:33:27.614 --> 00:33:29.963
 So if you're after herringbone,   or Prince of Wales,

00:33:29.963 --> 00:33:31.364
 it's a different set of pulls.

00:33:31.364 --> 00:33:33.754
 Amazing.   So this will happen to my wool?

00:33:33.754 --> 00:33:36.524
 All these tiny fibres will  get drawn through by Alison,

00:33:36.524 --> 00:33:37.693
to make up the pattern?

00:33:37.693 --> 00:33:39.244
 Yes, they will.

00:33:39.244 --> 00:33:41.683
 Incredible, isn't it?   Very labour-intensive.

00:33:41.683 --> 00:33:45.054
 It is, yes. People forget that.   It's a very time-consuming process.

00:33:45.054 --> 00:33:47.163
 Keep up the good work, Alison,   my wool is coming your way!

00:33:47.163 --> 00:33:50.723
 'This small weaving company, with  all its tradition,

00:33:50.723 --> 00:33:53.443
 'is now led by entrepreneur  Deborah Meaden,

00:33:53.443 --> 00:33:56.163
 'because  she shares my passion for wool.'

00:33:56.163 --> 00:33:59.443
 I stepped across the  threshold, I smelt it,

00:33:59.443 --> 00:34:01.794
 I heard the sound, and I loved it.

00:34:01.794 --> 00:34:05.824
 But my business side was  able to come absolutely

00:34:05.824 --> 00:34:07.653
 bang on together with my heart,

00:34:07.653 --> 00:34:11.443
 because it's a good business,   and it's in a fabulous industry.

00:34:11.443 --> 00:34:13.084
 It's just great to work here.

00:34:13.084 --> 00:34:16.184
 At one time, the nation was  built on wool, wasn't it?

00:34:16.184 --> 00:34:19.884
 It was such a valuable product.   And if we can pull that back...

00:34:19.884 --> 00:34:22.324
 I don't think that we're ever  going to dominate the world

00:34:22.324 --> 00:34:24.574
 with wool again.   Actually, we don't have the space.

00:34:24.574 --> 00:34:28.983
 We can't. But what we can do is find  our place in that market,

00:34:28.983 --> 00:34:32.313
 and we are  not fulfilling that at the moment.

00:34:32.313 --> 00:34:34.744
We've kind of walked away,   we said well, you know,

00:34:34.744 --> 00:34:36.063
 we don't do wool anymore.

00:34:36.063 --> 00:34:37.744
 Well, actually, we do.

00:34:37.744 --> 00:34:40.374
 Or we should. We should do it,   and we do do it well.  Brilliant.

00:34:40.374 --> 00:34:45.813
Well, I'm very excited about you  weaving some of my wool here.

00:34:45.813 --> 00:34:48.104
 And then eventually,   I'll end up with a suit!

00:34:48.104 --> 00:34:49.653
 So we should get it off the ground.

00:34:49.653 --> 00:34:54.014
 Absolutely. You're in good hands!

00:34:54.014 --> 00:34:55.653
 I think it's brilliant,

00:34:55.653 --> 00:35:00.014
 considering British wool's  heritage, that it's still in fashion.

00:35:00.014 --> 00:35:01.563
 And these fabrics are full of it.

00:35:01.563 --> 00:35:04.284
 And that's good news for the  wool off my sheep's backs.

00:35:04.284 --> 00:35:07.753
 And I think once Patrick, my Savile  Row tailor, gets hold of this lot,

00:35:07.753 --> 00:35:09.204
 he's going to be delighted.

00:35:09.204 --> 00:35:13.934
 And I can hardly wait to see how my  suit will turn out.

00:35:18.153 --> 00:35:21.204
 Next week on my farm, it's time to wean the Gloucester calves

00:35:21.204 --> 00:35:22.844
 born in the spring from the cows.

00:35:32.083 --> 00:35:35.833
 For over a decade, the Countryfile  calendar has been doing its bit

00:35:35.833 --> 00:35:36.864
 for Children in Need.

00:35:36.864 --> 00:35:38.224
 Every year, with your help,

00:35:38.224 --> 00:35:41.173
 it raises more money and that  means more help for youngsters.

00:35:41.173 --> 00:35:43.474
 Yes, Children in Need supports  all kinds of young people.

00:35:43.474 --> 00:35:45.903
 It organises things like  on trips for city kids

00:35:45.903 --> 00:35:47.403
 and even helps youth clubs.

00:35:47.403 --> 00:35:50.594
 Your generosity is vital to that  work, so here is a reminder of how

00:35:50.594 --> 00:35:55.233
 you can buy the Countryfile calendar  and do your bit once again.

00:35:58.664 --> 00:36:02.554
The calendar costs ï¿½9 and a minimum   of ï¿½4 from each sale

00:36:02.554 --> 00:36:05.733
 will go on  to BBC's Children in Need appeal.

00:36:05.733 --> 00:36:07.983
 You can order the calendar  in three ways.

00:36:07.983 --> 00:36:11.503
 First, you can go to our website,   where you can spin through all those

00:36:11.503 --> 00:36:14.884
fantastic pictures, or go slowly,   if you like, savouring every one of

00:36:14.884 --> 00:36:17.644
them, until you get to the bottom of  the page

00:36:17.644 --> 00:36:20.594
 where you click on the link  to buy the calendar.

00:36:20.594 --> 00:36:27.864
 Or you can order one by  phone, by dialling 0844 811 7044.

00:36:27.864 --> 00:36:29.503
 Or you could buy one by post.

00:36:29.503 --> 00:36:33.583
 Send your name, address and cheque to

00:36:33.583 --> 00:36:40.854
 BBC Countryfile Calendar, PO Box 25,   Melton Mowbray, LE13 1ZG.

00:36:40.854 --> 00:36:44.134
 Please make your cheques payable  to BBC Countryfile.

00:36:52.753 --> 00:36:54.963
We're exploring the  county of Surrey.

00:36:54.963 --> 00:36:57.684
 From the woodland of the Surrey hills,

00:36:57.684 --> 00:37:00.443
 I have travelled north to the  heathland

00:37:00.443 --> 00:37:02.744
 around Camberley and Sandhurst.

00:37:04.713 --> 00:37:08.463
 Sandhurst is the home of the  Royal Military Academy.

00:37:08.463 --> 00:37:12.023
 There's been a military college here  for over 200 years,

00:37:12.023 --> 00:37:14.744
 and the list of ex-cadets is a real  Who's Who,

00:37:14.744 --> 00:37:18.494
 from the explorer Chris Bonington,   to Winston Churchill.

00:37:18.494 --> 00:37:21.914
 Even Princes William and Harry trained here,

00:37:21.914 --> 00:37:24.634
 so we're talking  the real top brass.

00:37:28.764 --> 00:37:31.193
700 cadets come through the gates  each year

00:37:31.193 --> 00:37:33.773
 to be trained as officers  in the British Army.

00:37:36.773 --> 00:37:39.494
 And before they leave, every single  one of them

00:37:39.494 --> 00:37:42.583
 will get to know this  landscape really, really well.

00:37:42.583 --> 00:37:45.914
 Because THIS  is their training ground.

00:37:52.713 --> 00:37:55.104
 I'll be seeing more of that  training in a little while.

00:37:55.104 --> 00:38:00.164
 But first, I'm off to find out about  life as a trainee officer here.

00:38:00.164 --> 00:38:03.874
 So Tim, how do you  actually get to Sandhurst?

00:38:03.874 --> 00:38:05.233
 Do new recruits turn up here,

00:38:05.233 --> 00:38:07.059
 or do you have to  have done training first?

00:38:07.059 --> 00:38:09.409
They'll have gone through  a selection process.

00:38:09.409 --> 00:38:12.450
 The officers' selection  board down at Westbury,

00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:15.639
 where we're really looking at them  to see what potential they've got.

00:38:15.639 --> 00:38:17.980
They can go to the selection process  any time

00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:21.030
 between the ages of 17 and 28.   And how long do they stay here?

00:38:21.030 --> 00:38:23.190
 For a year, most of them.

00:38:23.190 --> 00:38:25.250
 Our core business is what's called

00:38:25.250 --> 00:38:29.280
 the Regular Army Commissioning  Course, that's those cadets who are

00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:32.849
 wanting to join the regular army,  they come to us for a year,

00:38:32.849 --> 00:38:35.380
 in which they work bloody hard!

00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:38.940
 I shouldn't say bloody!  They work extremely hard.

00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:43.630
 And we're trying to really judge  whether they've got the potential

00:38:43.630 --> 00:38:47.139
to have that fantastic honour of  leading our soldiers on operations.

00:38:47.139 --> 00:38:51.030
 And so ultimately, we need to  have the confidence that they've

00:38:51.030 --> 00:38:55.909
 got the ability to make the right  decision on a really difficult day.

00:38:55.909 --> 00:38:58.490
 It is quite a place, isn't it?

00:38:58.490 --> 00:39:02.659
 It is.  Standing here now, and looking  back at these buildings,

00:39:02.659 --> 00:39:04.490
there's some atmosphere.

00:39:04.490 --> 00:39:06.130
 It's a spectacular environment.

00:39:06.130 --> 00:39:08.470
 600 acres inside the wire here.

00:39:08.470 --> 00:39:10.769
 In the middle, as we are,   of a fairly suburban,

00:39:10.769 --> 00:39:12.320
 built up, Camberley, Surrey.

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:15.460
 But it's a wonderful site and  we've been here for 200 years,

00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:17.150
 pretty much doing this.

00:39:17.150 --> 00:39:19.110
 And with the cuts as well coming,

00:39:19.110 --> 00:39:21.880
 how do you think  that's going to affect things?

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:23.800
Well, I think at the junior  level of course,

00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:27.220
they're all wonderfully ambitions and their horizons are fairly short term.

00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:29.099
 So I don't think the  cadets are too worried.

00:39:29.099 --> 00:39:30.829
 And I'm fairly confident that  actually,

00:39:30.829 --> 00:39:32.710
 we're going to  keep doing what we're doing.

00:39:32.710 --> 00:39:34.349
We're still going to  need to train officers.

00:39:34.349 --> 00:39:35.849
 I suspect we'll be training

00:39:35.849 --> 00:39:38.289
 in about the same  numbers, despite the cuts.

00:39:38.289 --> 00:39:40.730
 So this place, I think, has a pretty  good enduring future.

00:39:43.349 --> 00:39:46.960
 Life at Sandhurst revolves around the spectacular old college,

00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.039
 built in 1812.

00:39:48.039 --> 00:39:51.550
 Over 700 or so officer cadets,   male and female,

00:39:51.550 --> 00:39:55.159
 all live on site  during their year-long course.

00:39:55.159 --> 00:39:58.260
 As well as being their home, it's  also where they learn

00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:01.119
 leadership skills  and tactics in the classroom.

00:40:01.119 --> 00:40:06.039
 But it's out here on the 1,400  acres of heathland that surrounds

00:40:06.039 --> 00:40:10.679
 the academy, that officer cadets are  put through their practical paces.

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:18.840
 Is it what you expected it to be?

00:40:18.840 --> 00:40:21.320
 Yes.   There's a lot of sleep deprivation,

00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:23.200
 that's the main thing, I think.

00:40:23.200 --> 00:40:25.820
 But no, it's been OK, I think!

00:40:25.820 --> 00:40:28.170
 Has it?!  Not too bad!

00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:29.950
 It's a pretty harsh  environment out there.

00:40:29.950 --> 00:40:31.490
 Can you put it into words for us,

00:40:31.490 --> 00:40:34.119
 what it feels like when  you're out there training?

00:40:34.119 --> 00:40:36.280
We went on exercise last week

00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:40.639
 and the most we got was probably  four hours' sleep a week.

00:40:40.639 --> 00:40:44.289
 So that was quite amazing. People  were staring off into the distance,

00:40:44.289 --> 00:40:47.530
just thinking they could see things  and definitely couldn't!  Incredible.

00:40:47.530 --> 00:40:52.360
 So obviously, you all met six months  ago, you go through your training.

00:40:52.360 --> 00:40:55.030
When you leave,   do you still all stay together,

00:40:55.030 --> 00:40:57.510
 or do you get  posted out to different parts?

00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:59.570
 You're sort of dispersed across the  army,

00:40:59.570 --> 00:41:02.340
 into all your different regiments,   units, whether it be

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:05.059
 Infantry, Air Corps,   anything like that.

00:41:05.059 --> 00:41:08.950
 But obviously, I think most of  us are going to remain friends.

00:41:08.950 --> 00:41:11.340
 Speaking to people who were  commissioned before,

00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:13.220
 they stay  in touch and meet once a year.

00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:15.190
 It's probably hard not to,   if you go through all of this.

00:41:20.010 --> 00:41:21.610
 Outside of the secure  shooting range,

00:41:21.610 --> 00:41:24.190
 large areas of the army-owned  heathland are not only used every

00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:27.840
 day for training, but they're  also accessible to the public.

00:41:30.050 --> 00:41:33.050
 Though it might look tough,   the heathland environment

00:41:33.050 --> 00:41:34.550
 is actually quite fragile,

00:41:34.550 --> 00:41:39.139
 and the military have been working  with Natural England

00:41:39.139 --> 00:41:40.829
 to protect the land.

00:41:40.829 --> 00:41:44.579
 Des, how do you go about  managing an area the size

00:41:44.579 --> 00:41:48.420
that this is, when you've got so  many cadets traipsing all over it?

00:41:48.420 --> 00:41:51.519
Well, the military have  really done a great job.

00:41:51.519 --> 00:41:56.579
They've tried to balance the needs  of their training purposes with

00:41:56.579 --> 00:41:58.740
 not compromising the special values

00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:01.360
 for the nature conservation  we've got here.

00:42:01.360 --> 00:42:06.050
The next phase of that is to  introduce some cattle grazing here in

00:42:06.050 --> 00:42:09.849
 the future, using Galloway animals  to come in here.

00:42:09.849 --> 00:42:13.500
 And they'll help to do a lot of  the hard conservation work

00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:16.599
that's been done by  contractors, volunteers.

00:42:16.599 --> 00:42:18.849
 And their grazing will also  help to reduce

00:42:18.849 --> 00:42:21.420
 the amount of undergrowth that's accumulating.

00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:24.240
 So that will help to open up  more opportunities for some

00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:27.849
 of the rarer endangered  insects and plants that live here.

00:42:27.849 --> 00:42:31.599
This place just stretches to  the horizon, all the way round.

00:42:31.599 --> 00:42:36.240
 And if it wasn't for the military,   it wouldn't look like this.

00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:40.409
 We are in the Thames basin,   heaths area, which actually

00:42:40.409 --> 00:42:43.690
 has got a lot of fantastic habitats,

00:42:43.690 --> 00:42:49.690
 all squeezed among some very big  and fast growing developments.

00:42:49.690 --> 00:42:54.190
Without the army's presence here,   a lot of this land might be put under

00:42:54.190 --> 00:42:58.180
 severe pressure for all sorts of  land use and purposes.

00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:02.490
 So it's testament to its protection  as a training area

00:43:02.490 --> 00:43:06.710
that we're able to  stand here in the corner of Surrey,

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:09.849
 actually enjoying such a  huge area of open space.

00:43:15.760 --> 00:43:19.369
 As well as training, this  landscape is also the venue

00:43:19.369 --> 00:43:21.190
 for serious competition.

00:43:21.190 --> 00:43:23.349
 A gruelling endurance race

00:43:23.349 --> 00:43:28.130
that's part of the annual contest  to find the best platoon.

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:31.789
 Every cadet will have done  this in his time at Sandhurst.

00:43:31.789 --> 00:43:36.570
 It's over six miles, over the common,   up hill, down dale, across country.

00:43:36.570 --> 00:43:40.180
Those who are yet to come will always  be told this is the worst possible

00:43:40.180 --> 00:43:41.909
thing that can ever happen to you.

00:43:41.909 --> 00:43:47.159
 It'll take them about an hour,   probably, of really good, hard sweat.

00:43:47.159 --> 00:43:50.070
 The race starts at dawn.

00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:52.840
 First, the three platoons  face a straight run

00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:54.849
from the base on to the heathland.

00:44:00.950 --> 00:44:04.090
 The platoons are now 1.3 miles  into the course and they're

00:44:04.090 --> 00:44:06.619
 carrying these stretchers now  for just over a mile.

00:44:06.619 --> 00:44:09.570
We'd better stand out of the way,   because they don't stop!

00:44:11.490 --> 00:44:18.250
 The makeshift stretcher  actually weighs 60 kilos, and each  platoon has to stay together

00:44:18.250 --> 00:44:21.570
 for over a mile and  deposit it at the top of the hill.

00:44:25.039 --> 00:44:27.530
Then, there's a recovery period.

00:44:27.530 --> 00:44:30.480
 A one-mile march, which has to  be covered in 13 minutes.

00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:33.760
 Keep it tight, you're on camera!

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:40.000
 The next load is an 11 ft long log.

00:44:47.309 --> 00:44:49.000
 You can just hear all the guys screaming,

00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:50.590
 with those that are carrying the  log,

00:44:50.590 --> 00:44:53.500
 because they've got a rope around,   they have to keep in front of it.

00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:56.119
 It's the most important thing,  just to keep that momentum going.

00:44:58.139 --> 00:45:02.220
 It's a crisp and cold  autumn morning and for the cadets,

00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:04.190
 it's also going to get wet.

00:45:13.559 --> 00:45:16.980
 Safely through the bog and up the  hill, it's back down to base.

00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:19.369
 And in  front of Sandhurst's new college,

00:45:19.369 --> 00:45:23.079
the final team make it home,   cheered on by the other platoons.

00:45:25.188 --> 00:45:27.588
 That was impressive, man!

00:45:27.588 --> 00:45:30.818
 How do you feel now?

00:45:30.818 --> 00:45:33.159
Tired!  I bet you do!

00:45:33.159 --> 00:45:36.588
 What was the hardest bit?

00:45:36.588 --> 00:45:40.519
 Probably the logs.   You set off at an incredible pace,

00:45:40.519 --> 00:45:43.709
 and you must think,   we've got a long way to go.

00:45:43.709 --> 00:45:45.909
 How do you pace yourself?   That's the problem, really.

00:45:45.909 --> 00:45:47.878
 Bravado sets in, and sadly,  the cameras are here

00:45:47.878 --> 00:45:49.148
 as well,   so we had to dig in more!

00:45:49.148 --> 00:45:52.148
 Yeah, yeah, got to keep smiling!   Something like that, yeah!

00:45:52.148 --> 00:45:54.959
 But it was incredible,   and pulling bits and pieces

00:45:54.959 --> 00:45:56.648
through the bog, it was just...

00:45:56.648 --> 00:45:58.898
 You don't fancy jumping on a log,   giving us a hand?! Well...

00:45:58.898 --> 00:46:02.878
 I was cheering you on!  You looked  like you were going to help out!

00:46:02.878 --> 00:46:05.318
 Listen, huge congratulations, lads.

00:46:05.318 --> 00:46:08.229
 Honestly, well done. I'm sure you're  going to get yourself sorted out

00:46:08.229 --> 00:46:11.648
 and go for a shower and stuff, but  it was really, really impressive.

00:46:11.648 --> 00:46:13.849
 Cheers. Thanks very much.

00:46:13.849 --> 00:46:16.429
 If all of this activity has  whetted your appetite

00:46:16.429 --> 00:46:19.099
 for a bit of adventure, there are  thousands of free

00:46:19.099 --> 00:46:21.449
 or low-cost activities  all over the country.

00:46:21.449 --> 00:46:23.789
 And here is how you get started.

00:46:23.789 --> 00:46:27.729
 Since its launch this spring,   Countryfile and BBC Learning's

00:46:27.729 --> 00:46:30.499
Thrill Seeker has provided  more than 2,000

00:46:30.499 --> 00:46:33.259
 adventure activities  right across the UK.

00:46:33.259 --> 00:46:35.789
 For everyone from absolute  beginners, to adrenalin junkies.

00:46:35.789 --> 00:46:39.219
 To find out more, just go to the  Thrill Seeker website.

00:46:39.219 --> 00:46:43.528
There's an event finder to point  you to your nearest adventure,

00:46:43.528 --> 00:46:45.829
 and ideas for further pursuits.

00:46:45.829 --> 00:46:48.499
 There are more activities being  added every week, so give it a go,

00:46:48.499 --> 00:46:51.869
 get out there,   and become a Thrill Seeker.

00:47:00.079 --> 00:47:02.648
 This is the Surrey  market town of Dorking.

00:47:02.648 --> 00:47:06.028
 It doesn't look much like an  agricultural heartland now,

00:47:06.028 --> 00:47:08.509
 but once  it was famous for its livestock.

00:47:08.509 --> 00:47:11.418
 But I'm on a hunt for  an elusive fowl.

00:47:11.418 --> 00:47:14.659
This is a Dorking cockerel,   a breed named after the town.

00:47:14.659 --> 00:47:18.778
 And back in the day, the  Dorking was bred by the thousand.

00:47:18.778 --> 00:47:21.028
 Unusually, the Dorking has five toes.

00:47:21.028 --> 00:47:24.168
 In Victorian times,   it was hugely popular for its meat.

00:47:24.168 --> 00:47:28.809
 But today, this is the only  one I've found around here.

00:47:28.809 --> 00:47:32.189
 Do you know what this is?   A Dorking?  Yes!

00:47:32.189 --> 00:47:34.999
 Dorking cockerel.   Do you know where I can get one?

00:47:34.999 --> 00:47:37.809
 Afraid not!

00:47:38.139 --> 00:47:40.769
 Do you know where I   can get one these days?

00:47:40.769 --> 00:47:44.659
 Well, in some...  I tell you what, if  I rung my daughter up, she'd know.

00:47:44.659 --> 00:47:48.168
 ..the gift shop.  Do you know where I   can find one, that's the question?

00:47:51.358 --> 00:47:53.519
 Hmm, I'm not having much luck.

00:47:53.519 --> 00:47:56.608
 If I'm going to find out what these Dorkings are all about,

00:47:56.608 --> 00:47:58.159
 I'm going to need some help.

00:47:58.159 --> 00:48:01.579
 Now, the Dorking is a very  handsome bird, Pedro,

00:48:01.579 --> 00:48:03.599
 what qualities does it have?

00:48:03.599 --> 00:48:06.269
 Obviously,   apart from the five toes,

00:48:06.269 --> 00:48:09.878
 they are very short,   but long, so ideal table birds.

00:48:09.878 --> 00:48:11.469
 They're plump. That's right.

00:48:11.469 --> 00:48:13.349
 And because they are  short in the leg,

00:48:13.349 --> 00:48:14.939
 they tend to fill out a bit more.

00:48:14.939 --> 00:48:16.439
 Why did it fall out of favour?

00:48:16.439 --> 00:48:18.128
They're not economical.

00:48:18.128 --> 00:48:20.709
They're very slow growing, it takes ages for them to mature.

00:48:20.709 --> 00:48:23.429
 Egg capacity is very poor.

00:48:23.429 --> 00:48:26.519
 What about the name and the  association with this area?

00:48:26.519 --> 00:48:28.019
 Where does that come from?

00:48:28.019 --> 00:48:30.409
 It is  thought that the Romans brought over

00:48:30.409 --> 00:48:32.469
 a five-toed fowl around about 47 AD.

00:48:32.469 --> 00:48:37.108
 And in Victorian times, the  breeders around the area, Sussex,

00:48:37.108 --> 00:48:42.789
 Kent and Horsham, crossed different  breeds to produce what we know now

00:48:42.789 --> 00:48:45.369
 as the Dorking.  47 AD?

00:48:45.369 --> 00:48:47.239
 That's right, yes.   That is an old bird!

00:48:47.239 --> 00:48:49.439
 A very old bird!

00:48:50.989 --> 00:48:55.439
 But I still haven't found one. I'm  going to have to widen my search.

00:48:55.439 --> 00:48:58.298
Today, the Dorking is a rare breed,   and the only place you're likely to

00:48:58.298 --> 00:49:01.729
 find one is with a specialist  breeder or a collector.

00:49:01.729 --> 00:49:05.378
 Otherwise known as chicken fanciers.

00:49:06.789 --> 00:49:09.699
 Poultry fancying  has a long tradition.

00:49:09.699 --> 00:49:12.318
 Competitions to breed the  best looking birds

00:49:12.318 --> 00:49:13.959
 have been held for decades.

00:49:13.959 --> 00:49:18.878
 And with scant prize money on offer,   it's always been a labour of love.

00:49:18.878 --> 00:49:21.648
 I'm on my way to meet  a modern-day enthusiast.

00:49:21.648 --> 00:49:25.539
 Well, I've located a breeder that specialises in Dorkings,

00:49:25.539 --> 00:49:29.338
 so hopefully I'll get a  closer look at these beasties.

00:49:33.599 --> 00:49:35.239
 Hi, Lana, hello.   Nice to meet you.

00:49:35.239 --> 00:49:37.398
 I must say, I was  expecting that to be a chicken!

00:49:37.398 --> 00:49:39.559
 Well, I'm also mad on greyhounds.

00:49:39.559 --> 00:49:41.809
 Oh, I see.

00:49:45.369 --> 00:49:49.168
 Ah! So here we have a live Dorking!

00:49:49.168 --> 00:49:50.999
 Yes! Those are my birds.

00:49:50.999 --> 00:49:53.148
 And they are lovely.

00:49:53.148 --> 00:49:57.039
 Davy is a feisty young cockerel  with wonderful silver white plumage.

00:49:57.039 --> 00:50:00.139
 And Hannah is a dark Dorking female.

00:50:00.139 --> 00:50:02.009
 This is Hannah.  Right.

00:50:02.009 --> 00:50:03.749
 Come on, my darling.

00:50:03.749 --> 00:50:07.398
 Now, the best way to hold her,  that she's relaxed...

00:50:07.398 --> 00:50:10.028
We want her to be relaxed.   She's quite a heavy lump.

00:50:10.028 --> 00:50:12.889
 You have to  have two fingers between her legs.

00:50:12.889 --> 00:50:17.289
 Yeah?  See her five toes? And  let her breastbone sit on your arm.

00:50:17.289 --> 00:50:22.119
 I see. Then she'll be completely  relaxed and happy to be in your arms.

00:50:22.119 --> 00:50:24.648
 OK, let's have a go. So, two  fingers under there, like that?

00:50:24.648 --> 00:50:26.249
Two fingers between her legs.  Right.

00:50:26.249 --> 00:50:28.079
 And support her weight.

00:50:28.079 --> 00:50:30.648
There we go. That's lovely.  Then she'll be quite happy.

00:50:30.648 --> 00:50:32.148
 So how did you get into it, Lana?

00:50:32.148 --> 00:50:36.278
Well, when I first moved here, I  thought, I've got into chickens,

00:50:36.278 --> 00:50:38.479
 I might as well keep  a local breed.

00:50:38.479 --> 00:50:41.199
 But I realised after doing  some research on them,

00:50:41.199 --> 00:50:42.278
 they are quite rare.

00:50:42.278 --> 00:50:45.088
 I felt it would be a good  thing for me to conserve them.

00:50:45.088 --> 00:50:46.729
 I became one of the  Dorking conservers!

00:50:46.729 --> 00:50:48.369
 So that's your passion now?

00:50:48.369 --> 00:50:51.519
 It is.  Keep it alive.  They really are my passion.

00:50:51.519 --> 00:50:53.059
 Hannah and I are bonding.

00:50:53.059 --> 00:50:57.088
 All chicken fanciers need to know  how to prepare a bird for show.

00:50:57.088 --> 00:51:00.659
Thousands will flock to the National  Poultry Show in the few weeks.

00:51:00.659 --> 00:51:02.949
 So I'm whisking Hannah off for a  bit of a hen party,

00:51:02.949 --> 00:51:05.159
 where I'm going to learn the tricks of the trade.

00:51:08.858 --> 00:51:10.969
 Hello, Pedro.  Hi, Julia.

00:51:10.969 --> 00:51:15.469
 There we go. Right, I come prepared  with bird. This is Hannah.

00:51:15.469 --> 00:51:17.528
 OK.  So I want you to show  me how

00:51:17.528 --> 00:51:20.389
 I should get  Hannah ready and sparkling.

00:51:20.389 --> 00:51:23.389
 It all starts with a healthy scrub.

00:51:23.389 --> 00:51:28.459
 Gently start covering her feathers,   you know, you don't  want to scare her off.

00:51:28.459 --> 00:51:33.798
 We're going to put a little bit  of shampoo, just rub it in deep.

00:51:33.798 --> 00:51:38.298
 Well, this is right up there with things I've never done before again!

00:51:38.298 --> 00:51:40.969
Which is washing a chicken.

00:51:40.969 --> 00:51:43.739
This, though, is just the beginning.

00:51:43.739 --> 00:51:46.599
 I thought  it took me a while to doll up,

00:51:46.599 --> 00:51:49.358
 but this chick's on another level.

00:51:49.358 --> 00:51:55.128
 # You don't have to be beautiful... #

00:51:55.128 --> 00:51:58.318
 I couldn't bear it if  someone was doing this to me!

00:51:58.318 --> 00:52:00.329
 Oh!

00:52:00.329 --> 00:52:01.829
 Oh!

00:52:01.829 --> 00:52:04.179
 Calm down, dear! Sorry.

00:52:04.179 --> 00:52:06.749
 'Hannah's scrubbing up nicely,

00:52:06.749 --> 00:52:11.398
 'but she'd better watch out, because there are other ladies in town.'

00:52:11.398 --> 00:52:13.739
What are they?   Oh, they're very cute.

00:52:13.739 --> 00:52:16.739
 We've got some Plymouth Rocks,   which are the brown ones,

00:52:16.739 --> 00:52:18.289
then we've got some Frizzles.

00:52:18.289 --> 00:52:19.548
 I've had to take the big girl out,

00:52:19.548 --> 00:52:21.329
 because the little  black one was having a go.

00:52:21.329 --> 00:52:24.898
 So there's a lot  of feathers over here at the moment!

00:52:24.898 --> 00:52:26.349
 They're looking for a PECKING order!

00:52:28.128 --> 00:52:32.298
 'As for Hannah,   it's on to the final touches.'

00:52:32.298 --> 00:52:34.548
 Look, she's loving that!

00:52:34.548 --> 00:52:38.818
Just rub it round her feet and legs.

00:52:38.818 --> 00:52:44.298
 # I just want you  extra time and your...kiss. #

00:52:44.298 --> 00:52:46.979
 'But is she good enough to show?

00:52:46.979 --> 00:52:49.369
 'Rodney Woods is an experienced judge,

00:52:49.369 --> 00:52:52.409
 'and he's dropped by  to give our girl the once over.'

00:52:52.409 --> 00:52:57.949
 The finer points of what we're going  to be looking for is the markings,

00:52:57.949 --> 00:53:02.588
 the colour of a hen, particularly  whether she's got the five toes.

00:53:02.588 --> 00:53:06.099
Well, she definitely has.   She's got the five toes?

00:53:06.099 --> 00:53:08.068
 I'm no expert,   but I can tell you that!

00:53:08.068 --> 00:53:11.169
 And she's got white legs,   all Dorkings have white legs.

00:53:11.169 --> 00:53:14.729
 This part of the  hackle should be a bit more straw,

00:53:14.729 --> 00:53:17.349
 so that's just lacking a  little bit.

00:53:17.349 --> 00:53:19.889
 But the base colour, with the white

00:53:19.889 --> 00:53:23.729
 running down the centre of  each feather, is spot on.

00:53:25.789 --> 00:53:27.389
 She's not a bad Dorking.

00:53:27.389 --> 00:53:31.039
 Not a bad Dorking! So I shouldn't  be embarrassed?  No, absolutely not.

00:53:31.039 --> 00:53:33.199
 Hannah has done Lana and me proud?

00:53:33.199 --> 00:53:35.358
 Yes, absolutely.

00:53:35.358 --> 00:53:37.889
 I wouldn't be ashamed to show that in any show.

00:53:37.889 --> 00:53:41.028
 I always knew she  was a top flight bird!

00:53:41.028 --> 00:53:44.588
 And I reckon she beats the other one hands down.

00:53:44.588 --> 00:53:46.929
 Well, that's it from me, and Hannah.

00:53:46.929 --> 00:53:50.028
 Next week we're in the Chilterns,   catching the last glimpse of autumn.
