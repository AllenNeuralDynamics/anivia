## [2.0.0] - July 15, 2018
 * rectangles can now be resized from edges (issue 120)
 * added POLYLINE shape
   - polygon region shape coordinates set does not end with the first coordinate (closed loop is defined by the shape: polygon, polyline)
 * renamed many methods and variables
 * attributes editor
   - added _via_attributes{'region','file'} and removed _via_region_attributes, _via_file_attributes
   - attributes add/remove/update from left sidebar panel
   - attribute types: text (default), checkbox, radio, dropdown, image (from url or base64 encoded image data)
 * annotation editor
   - similar to previous versions (spreadsheet like editor) supporting attribute types: text, checkbox, radio, etc
   - tabbed panel for region and file attribute editor
   - change size of contents and panel
 * via project save/load
   - everything (annotations, attributes, application settings, etc) can now be saved as a VIA project (a json file)
 * exported csv annotation header line does not contain "#" (this may be a breaking change) (issue 122)
 * zoom level does not reset when navigating prev/next images (issue 125)
 * VIA project: open/save
   - image file list can be filtered using regular expression
   - preset filters for image file list
   - shortcuts to add files to project (local, url) and remove files from project
   - files in local disk drive can also be added using absolute path (e.g. /home/tlm/image1.jpg)
   - project settings
 * paste regions in multiple images and option to undo this operation (issue 123)
 * (simplified code) image content is shown using <img> instead of <canvas> (region shapes still shown using <canvas>)
 * image grid to perform bulk operations on a set of images (like changing file attribute of multiple images)
   - group by operation supported on file and region attributes
   - multiple groups can be created
   - next/prev page navigation
   - increase/decrease size of image shown in image grid
 * images are preloaded and buffered to allow faster and smoother prev/next image navigation
 * image data can be pulled from custom locations in local disk in order to resolve image files
 * shortcut toolbar (in top) now uses icons from material icon set (https://material.io/icons/)
 * updated ImageMetadata() and RegionMetadata()
 * removed persistence of annotation data in browser cache (i.e. localStorage)
   - this feature proved difficult to maintain for cross browser support
   - uses "beforeunload" event to warn users of data loss
 * minor improvements
   - updated region shape color to yellow
   - selected regions can be precisely moved by 1 pixel using arrow keys (press Shift to move by 10 pixel)
   - move multiple selected regions
   - {polygon, polyline, point} regions can now be drawn inside existing regions (i.e. nested regions)
   - both polygon and polyline shape drawing operation is now ended by pressing [Enter] key
   - when region is selected, mouse wheel can be used to change the region label
   - center of circle and ellipse shapes remain fixed to mousedown location (major issue in 1.0.x versions)
 * updated regression test cases
 * polygon vertex can be added and removed (issue 134)
