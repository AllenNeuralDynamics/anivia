# Contributing to the VIA Open Source Project

VIA is an open source project and we welcome all forms of contributions
(code update, documentation, bug report, etc.) from users. All the contributions
must adhere to the existing [license](LICENSE) of the VIA project.

The VIA source code repository contains a separate folder for each
major version of VIA: [via-1.x.y](via-1.x.y/), [via-2.x.y](via-2.x.y/) and [via-3.x.y](via-3.x.y/).
The development of all versions is carried out in the `master` branch.
If you wish to contribute code to VIA (we encourage you to do so), please send
