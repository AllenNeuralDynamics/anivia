# Contributing to the VIA Open Source Project
VIA is an open source project and we welcome all forms of contributions 
(code update, documentation, bug report, etc.) from users. All the contributions
must adhere to the existing [license](LICENSE) of the VIA project.

The VIA source code repository contains a separate folder for each 
major version of VIA: [via-1.x.y](via-1.x.y/), [via-2.x.y](via-2.x.y/) and [via-3.x.y](via-3.x.y/).
The development of each version is carried out in a separate branch (e.g. [via-2.x.y branch](https://gitlab.com/vgg/via/tree/via-2.x.y).
If you wish to contribute code to VIA (we encourage you to do so), please send 
a pull request to one of the branches. Please do not send pull requests to the 
[master branch](https://gitlab.com/vgg/via/tree/master).

Each version of the VIA software maintains a list of their contributors in the 
following files:

 * [via-1.x.y/Contributors.md](via-1.x.y/Contributors.md)
 * [via-2.x.y/Contributors.md](via-2.x.y/Contributors.md)
 * [via-3.x.y/Contributors.md](via-3.x.y/Contributors.md)
