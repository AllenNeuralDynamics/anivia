> There was one tool I became fond of though— VGG Image Annotator (VIA) which had many great things about it (and was my inspiration), such as no setup usage (just open in the browser), worked with local files, was very fast and cross-platform. The only downside with it was no support for YOLO format (needed to write my own converting scripts). Also, I felt, navigation could be made more efficient.

> There are a lot of tools to annotate images. I ended up using VIA (VGG Image Annotator) because of its simplicity. It’s a single HTML file that you download and open in a browser. Annotating the first few images was very slow, but once I got used to the user interface, I was annotating at around an object a minute.
> VGG Image Annotator (VIA): Fast, light, and really well designed. This is the one I ended up using.
> The VIA tool saves the annotations in a JSON file, and each mask is a set of polygon points. I didn’t find documentation for the format, but it’s pretty easy to figure out by looking at the generated JSON.

> Thank for very much for this wonderful tool

* Email from Mark Mazumder <mazumder@csail.mit.edu> on 29 Aug. 2017
> Thanks for developing and supporting VIA, it's the best labeling tool I've used, and several people on my team have concurred after I suggested they try it! 

* Email from 유경윤 <rky0930@gmail.com> on July 15, 2018
> I'm big fan of VIA. Because VIA is only built using JS & HTML, There is no installation and It's really convenient to add more features I'm using via very well personally. Thank you so much for your amazing work. 

* Email from Mariano Metallo <nicolas.metallo@nyu.edu> on July 14, 2018
> I wanted to congratulate on the amazing work you and your team have done with the VGG Image Annotator. I've been working on building an open source solution for cities to evaluate their road surface quality (look for potholes, cracks, etc.) and I've been using VIA a lot to build my own annotated dataset.

> This awesome annotations tool, my team @shell use it on daily basis, I highly recommend it.

> It turned out that it was difficult finding any annotation tool that could meet those requirements. I did find one that was "almost great". This post is about truning that "almost great" into "great" (for my use case).
> With this simple modification I found I could do bounding-boxs and labels with 3 classes at a rate of 15-20 images per minute.
> VIA 1.0.6 is contained in a single html file that does not load any external javascript libraries. It is nearly 5000 lines of mostly javascript. It did take me awhile to figure out how add the functionality that I wanted. What I did is not elegant or representative of good coding practice. It's just a simple quick "hack" to make it do what I want.
> I'll end with a thank you to the VGG group for all of the great software they are making available to the community.

> Thanks a lot for your help. We already knew that this via tool could help in our work but with your help we are now able to integrate it with out local web app and we all really appreciate that. Thank you so much again.
